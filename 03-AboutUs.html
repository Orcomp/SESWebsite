about-us-content-description-p1: "We create simple solutions to complex business problems."
about-us-content-description-p2: "We've found that when you ask people to solve a very complex problem they usually create a very complex solution."
about-us-content-description-p3: "At SES we believe that the best solutions to problems are the simplest ones. We also believe that the more complex a problem is, the more important it is for the solution to be simple."
about-us-content-description-p4: "This is not easy to achieve, in fact it's quite difficult to come up with simple solutions to complex problems. We find that it takes a lot of very intense thinking and some very clever technology to keep things simple."
about-us-content-description-p5: "After reading the book <span>Start with Why</strong> by Simon Sineck, Ben and I realised that our <span>Why</strong> is that we both really enjoy solving problems, especially difficult and challenging ones."
# about-us-content-description-p6: "I personally was able to find this theme throughout my childhood. Starting with jigsaw puzzles, them moving on to working out how to separate metal wire puzzles, to reading "Solve a crime" puzzle books. After reading Start with Why, I realised that this was my why. This is what gets me out of bed in the morning and keeps me working until very late at night."
# about-us-content-description-p7: "More than that, with time and experience has come the desire to keep things as simple as possible and that is why I now strive to ensure I implement very effective soltuions to our clients problems while making sure the solutions are kept as simple as possible."
# about-us-content-description-p8: "There is a real elegance to this type of solution and it is extremely rewarding to be able to look back and say we've come up with a very elegant and simple way to solve this."
