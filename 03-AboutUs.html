about-us-content-description-p1: "We create simple solutions to complex business problems. We've found that quite often when very smart people are asked to solve a very complex problem they create a very complex solution. We believe that the best solutions to problems are the simplest ones. We also believe that the more complex a problem is the more important it is for the solution to be simple. This is not easy to achieve, in fact it is very difficult to come up with simple solutions to complex problems. We often find that is takes a lot of very clever thinking and some very clever technology to keep things simple. After reading the book "*Start with Why*" by Simon Sineck, Ben and I realised that our "*Why*" is that we really enjoy solving problems, especially difficult and challenging ones. I personally was able to find this theme throughout my childhood. Starting with jigsaw puzzles, them moving on to working out how to separate metal wire puzzles, to reading "Solve a crime" puzzle books. After reading Start with Why, I realised that this was my why. This is what gets me out of bed in the morning and keeps me working until very late at night. More than that, with time and experience has come the desire to keep things as simple as possible and that is why I now strive to ensure I implement very effective soltuions to our clients problems while making sure the solutions are kept as simple as possible. There is a real elegance to this type of solution and it is extremely rewarding to be able to look back and say we've come up with a very elegant and simple way to solve this."
